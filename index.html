    </div>
    <p> I was born and raised in New York City. My favorite part about living here is there is always something to do
        and somewhere to go. My least favorite part is missing the train or bus.<br>
        To relax, I enjoy playing video games. 
    </p>
    <p id="videogamelist">
        Here are some of my favorite video games:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Hollow Knight</li>
        <li> Skyrim</li>
        <li> Dragon Age Series </li>
        <li> The Pokemon Games</li>
    </ul>
    <p id="comment">
        I only started playing video games in the last 4 years and I'm not that good at them, but I still enjoy it. 
        Especially when the game has great music.
